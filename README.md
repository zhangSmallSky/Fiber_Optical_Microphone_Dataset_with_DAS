HCC: Data measured by the proposed fiber optic microphone.

HC: Data measured by the conventional fiber optic microphone.

Original Data Source: The raw audio for the mechanical fault dataset comes from https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09347.

The dataset comprises eight types of events: fan_abnormal, fan_normal, pump_abnormal, pump_normal, slider_abnormal, slider_normal, valve_abnormal, and valve_normal. Each audio clip has a duration of 10 seconds.

The acoustic signals captured by the fiber optic microphones were subsequently processed using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to generate their corresponding time-frequency spectrograms. As shown in the figure, the horizontal axis denotes time (0–10 s), the vertical axis represents frequency (0–6 kHz), and the color intensity corresponds to the amplitude of the acoustic signal.
